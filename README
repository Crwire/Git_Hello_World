This is a README file for the repo that I am using to practice github on. All code is basically from tutorials I've pulled around the web and from git etc, so if you're expecting something amazing then please look elsewhere.

Otherwise, stick around and if you're a beginner like I am (or was, hopefully) then hope you can learn a thing or two!
